# Week report 3
Time spent: 10h  

This week I:
- Added code analysis using cppcheck
- Removed the Burrows-wheeler transform and the move-to-front transform because they were extra work and didn't help with the compression
- Added Huffman coding
- Added arguments
- Added compressing and saving to file using the Canonical Huffman code
- Added Decompressing from a file
- Added compression and decompression tests using test input files

This week I made a good amount of progress.

I learned:
- How to analyze c++ code using cppcheck
- How Canonical Huffman code works and how to pad the end of a file
- How to do testing with test input files
- How to add extra info to tests
- How to get the current working directory and delete files in c++

I managed to figure everything out by myself and with the help of the internet, so I didn't have any major difficulties.  
Next, I will start coding the other compression algorithm.
