# Definition document

I will code Huffman encoding and the Lempel Ziv compression algorithm.  
This project uses the c++ programming language and the language of this project is English.  
I understand Java syntax and I can program with Python and c++, so I can probably do peer-reviewing on projects that use these languages.  
I study in the tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandidaattiohjelma.
