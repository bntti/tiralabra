# Week report 5
Time spent: 5h

This week I:
- Did the peer review
- Improved the documentation files

This week I didn't do that much progress, but the project is also almost complete.

I learned:
- That other compression algorithms are multiple times better than mine

I managed to figure everything out by myself and with the help of the internet, so I didn't have any major difficulties.  
Next, I will finish the documentation files and do the other peer review.
