# Week report 2
Time spent: 5h  

This week I:
- Refactored the project
- Added some code
- Added Makefiles
- Updated the readme
- Added this file
- Added tests
- Added code coverage that automatically generates when I push to GitHub
- Added documentation that automatically generates when I push to GitHub and is available on [GitHub pages](https://bntti.github.io/tiralabra/)

This week I made a good amount of progress.

I learned:
- How to write tests for c++
- How to automatically generate a code coverage report
- How to create documentation for c++
- How to automatically generate documentation and add it to GitHub pages when pushing to GitHub.
- How to have multiple targets in a Makefile

I managed to figure everything out by myself and with the help of the internet, so I didn't have any major difficulties.  
Next, I will start coding the compression algorithms.
