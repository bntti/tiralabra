# Week report 6
Time spent: 2h

This week I:
- Did the second peer review

This week I didn't do that much progress, but the project is also almost complete.

I learned:
- That `g++` and `make` are not pre-installed on Ubuntu.

I managed to figure everything out by myself and with the help of the internet, so I didn't have any major difficulties.  
Next, I will finish the documentation files.
