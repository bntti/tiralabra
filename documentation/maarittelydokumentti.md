I will code different kinds of compression algorithms.  
I will at least code Burrows-Wheeler transform + Move-to-front encoding + Huffman encoding and the Lempel Ziv compression algorithm. I will do more if I have the time.  
This project uses the c++ programming language and the language of this project is English.  
I understand Java syntax and I can program with Python and c++, so I can probably do peer-reviewing on projects that use these languages.  
I study in the tietojenkäsittelytieteen kandidaattiohjelma.
