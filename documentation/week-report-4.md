# Week report 4
Time spent: 9h

This week I:
- Refactored the project
- Added LZW coding
- Added more arguments
- Improved the usability of the program
- Added one more test file
- Improved the readme

This week I made a good amount of progress.

I learned:
- How to have multiple testing files
- How LZW coding works

I managed to figure everything out by myself and with the help of the internet, so I didn't have any major difficulties.  
Next, I will start improving the documentation files and do the peer review.
